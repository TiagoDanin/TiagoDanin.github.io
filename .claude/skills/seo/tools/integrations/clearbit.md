## API Pattern

Clearbit uses separate subdomains per API:
- `person.clearbit.com` - Person data
- `company.clearbit.com` - Company data, Name to Domain
- `person-stream.clearbit.com` - Streaming person lookup (blocking, up to 60s)
- `company-stream.clearbit.com` - Streaming company lookup (blocking, up to 60s)
- `reveal.clearbit.com` - IP to company
- `prospector.clearbit.com` - Employee search

Standard endpoints return `202 Accepted` if data is being processed (use webhooks). Stream endpoints block until data is ready.
